# Coloring Pages

Coloring pages for kids in vector format (SVG). Each image is drawn with pure black lines on a transparent background.
A list of all files from the "images" folder plus difficulty estimate per drawing is generated as "./collection.json". The difficulty calculation is based on the number of empty areas and their sizes.

## Preview pictures

All pictures are listed in a storybook.

## Difficulty calculation

The difficulty is calculated based on the number of empty areas and their sizes.
See: `utils/DifficultyEstimator.ts` for details.

```
type Difficulty = {
    totalAreas: number;
    smallAreas: number;
    mediumAreas: number;
    difficultyNumber: number; // total + (medium * 1.5) + (small * 2)
}
```
